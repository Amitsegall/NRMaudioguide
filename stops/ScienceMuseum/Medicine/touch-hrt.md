This is a model showing a cross section of a human heart. You’re welcome to touch and explore the model. It’s attached to an L-shaped bronze coloured table with a white top, at a height of 75 centimetres. The display is a freestanding unit, at the end of a series of glass cabinets. To hear the description, position yourself so that the model is to the right, with large print and Braille labels to the left.  

The model is the size of an average adult human heart. It has been shown as if cut in cross section, from top to bottom. Different shades of pink and purple have been used to differentiate the areas of the heart. As you explore the heart, you should be able to identify its four distinct chambers. They’re coloured a deep pink. The two upper chambers – or atria – are smaller and rounded in shape. The two lower ones – or ventricles – are larger and more elongated.  

You can also feel the veins and arteries that leave the heart. At the top of the model is a large curving form representing the aorta. It has three arteries leading out of it.  

Behind the aorta is a wide tube representing the superior vena cava.  

Below and to the right of the aorta is the pulmonary artery, which forks off into two tubes. All these major blood vessels have been coloured a vivid pink.  

Running down inside the ventricles – or lower chambers – from top to bottom are ridges of muscle. These have been coloured a very pale pink.  

At the top of these ridges, between the top and bottom chambers, are two valves: they’re flattish and circular in form, divided into flaps. You can find two more valves closer to the centre of the heart: they’re located at the lower part of the large tubes, and have open flaps. These four valves are coloured the same pale pink as the ridges of muscle.

The human heart is one of the strongest muscles in the human body. It beats more than a hundred thousand times a day. At each beat, the left side pumps oxygen-rich blood around the body, while the right side pumps blood to the lungs to be oxygenated. The valves between the top and bottom chambers ensure one-way blood flow, and create the thumping heartbeat sound as they open and close.  

The model is part of a display about heart transplants. In the line of cabinets extending beyond the model are items related to surgery including surgical instruments and scrubs.

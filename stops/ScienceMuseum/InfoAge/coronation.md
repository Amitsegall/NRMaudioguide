## Susan Reed
It seemed endless. It seemed to start early in the morning, which it probably did. I can’t remember what time it finished, but it seemed like for ever to a little one. But I can picture it in my mind, I can see her walking down and then I can see her coming away from the altar, carrying the sceptre. I think it was a sceptre in her hand. And all the little pageboys behind her trying to move the train and, oh it was a wonderful thing.

## Alan Reed
We were one of the first people in the street to have a television, and the first one I can remember, which I’m pretty sure was the one we had at the time of the coronation, was a 12-inch Pye, black and white of course, with just a square box really, although the bottom of the front below the screen was sloped backwards and the volume and brilliance controls protruded from that.

## Rosamund Wallinger
I don’t remember any of the preliminary, any of the excitement, nothing. Just you’ve got to behave, got to be looking all prettily dressed, and then it’s a small room and all the curtains are shut and it  gets dark and the television’s switched on. And I suppose we saw that funny whirligig at the
beginning of the programmes that went on for some time, and then the coronation itself, all in black and white on a small screen, and silence in the room, nobody saying, ‘Oh look at that. Ah.’ [laughs]

## Gwenn Platts-Taylor       
All of us went one way and another back to the friend’s house for the television, and they’d recently bought this and it was quite a small television and they’d also bought one of these great big magnifying domes which was strapped onto the television set [laughs]. And it was alright if you sat in front of it, but if you got a bit on the side, because there was quite a crowd watching in the room, and  you got a bit of a blurred figure that got big and small and everything else [laughs]. But we could  see enough to know what was going on. That was  quite good. And they had sandwiches, sausage rolls, tea, coffee, all that sort of thing all throughout the  day. We didn’t move from the television set [laughs].

## Dai Gealy      
I can remember when I arrived at home, my mother telling me, ‘You’ve been lucky,’ she said. ‘Stan Baker’, who lived next door, ‘has just won a television set  on the rugby football raffle.’ And, God this is marvellous, I’ll be able to see this now, see the coronation. What she didn’t say was that half of our street had also been invited to watch this television. So you can just imagine, two up, two down, and you’ve got, I would imagine, it must have been 50-plus people tried to see this. And my view, I can vividly remember it, of the actual coronation was sort of under the armpits of somebody. I could just about see through, this very grainy film.

## Sylvia Cox        
You’re brought up with stories of princesses and so forth, and golden carriages and whatever, but this really was it. Obviously we couldn’t see the gold but we imagined it. And one of the things that really struck me and kept amazing me all the way through the day was the fact that I was here in Sunderland and we were seeing events, historic events that we would remember all our lives, hundreds of miles away in London. And it was as it happened, it wasn’t just a film that we were seeing after it had been taken, it was something that was happening now, and it really was amazing.

## Mary Taylor       
We didn’t have a television in those days, not many people around our area did, and so we went to my grandma’s house. She lived in a tiny, tiny cottage
in Bardsley, which is a little hamlet really, outside Oldham in Lancashire. And we all trooped up, I think it took two buses to get there, and we watched on a very small little set, I believe it was 9 or 12 inch. I don’t know whether it was Ekco or Bush, but it was a very, very tiny little screen, and there was myself, my sister, my brother, my mother, my father joined us later from work, and my auntie, and she had a daughter and she’d just had twins. So it was chaos [laughs], absolute chaos [laughs].

## Rosamund Wallinger       
There was a feeling of enormous importance, not so much excitement, about the day. And we had just come out of World War Two. It may sound like a long time later but it was fewer than ten years, and it was a time for a sort of burst of enthusiasm and freedom and celebration, albeit on somebody else’s level. And there was no feeling, at any stage that I remember, of jealousy or malice that this extravaganza was going on while the rest of England was still rationed. I think it was just a wonderful display of a resurrection of a country from a world war.

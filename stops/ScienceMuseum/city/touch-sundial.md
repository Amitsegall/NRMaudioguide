This is an audio description of a brass sundial. It is on display here and available to touch. The sundial is an unfinished replica based on an original dating from around 1607 to 1653. The brass has been polished to a highly reflective shine.  

The sundial is octagonal, with a flat dial plate 26 centimetres in diameter. Sticking up vertically in the centre is a brass gnomon which casts the shadow for telling the time. The gnomon consists of a triangular base of 6 centimetres, supporting a thin arm 18 centimetres long, set at 51.5 degrees. This is the latitude of London, where the original sundial was designed to be used. Whilst some sundials were fixed vertically on walls, this one is designed to be mounted horizontally on a base, with the gnomon aligned north to south.

A design has been inscribed on the dial plate. It has been worked to two different stages of finish, to show the processes involved. To the left of the gnomon, the design is unfinished, with shallow guidelines lightly scratched with a metal scribing tool. To the right it is almost complete, with the lines deeply engraved using a tool called a graver.  

Around the outer edge is a series of concentric circles marked with various mathematical scales for different calculations. The widest ring is approximately 2 centimetres across and is engraved with large Roman numerals, which are used to give the hour of the day. A slender outer ring divides the hours into half and quarter hours; and outside that, an even finer ring gives three-minute intervals. In the centre of the dial is a decorative sunburst, 10 centimetres wide, with a small central circle and 16 evenly spaced flame motifs erupting from it.

This replica has been hand-engraved by silversmith and engraver Angus McFadyen, using materials, tools and techniques that have hardly changed for centuries. Here he is to explain his process:

Engraving is basically drawing on metal, so the first thing you have to do is to draw on the metal. And the simplest thing to use is a pencil, obviously, but once youâ€™ve drawn on the metal you need to mark it in more permanently before you start engraving. So we use a scribe to do that and that scratches the metal, if you like, scratches the surface of the metal sufficiently,  that you then have a permanent line that you can follow with the graver and the graver is cutting metal, so you are removing metal. Which leaves you a line of all sorts of depths or widths according to the job. A very versatile process.

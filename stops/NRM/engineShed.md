## GREAT HALL: THE NOISY ENGINE SHED

Standing where we are right now, it’s hard to believe that the Great Hall was ever anything other than a very large, very clean museum space. But let’s imagine we’ve gone back in time one hundred years and we’re actually in the middle of a dark, grease-ridden, noisy engine shed. From the late nineteenth century all the way up to the museum’s grand unveiling in the 1970s, this was the place where locomotives (the powered vehicles that get trains moving) were stored and maintained first by North Eastern Railway and later by British Rail.

The photograph on your phone, taken in the early 1950s by Bishop Eric Treacy, gives us a real indicator of what York North Engine Shed looked like back when it was in full use. But let’s go one step further and really get some dirt under our fingernails. Look up at the ceiling and imagine pulling it down so it’s just a couple of metres above our heads. Imagine taking a hosepipe full of grease, soot, muck and grime, and spray it over everything, including the windows and the wonderful locomotives we have on display here – they certainly wouldn’t have looked so polished! Now take a deep breath and smell the air, there’s burnt coal in the atmosphere; the smell of steam, diesel and cigarettes from the workers running all around us. And finally, there would be the noise; the endless whirring, the shouting of engineers trying to hear one another over the chaotic atmosphere.

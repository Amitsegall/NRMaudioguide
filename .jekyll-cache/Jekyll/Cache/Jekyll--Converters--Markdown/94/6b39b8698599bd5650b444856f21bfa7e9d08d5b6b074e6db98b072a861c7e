<p>Iâ€™m Susie Orbach. Iâ€™m a psychotherapist and a psychoanalyst. I spend my days listening to people. <br />
Itâ€™s such a big question: what are talking therapies?<br />
Talking therapies from my perspective are just as much listening therapies because weâ€™re both listening in on one personâ€™s soul, heart, and mind.<br />
I think the way to define it is the you create an atmosphere in the therapeutic encounter in which<br />
the person can talk about what ails them.</p>

<p>One big misconception is that we tell people what to do. Itâ€™s a much more tender, but also sophisticated conversation about anguishing states of being, for me it very much celebrates change in people and tries to underpin it.<br />
Itâ€™s beautifulâ€¦ Itâ€™s taxing but it also is, gives you quite a lot. I think thereâ€™s a muscle that one develops as a therapist which is to be present and available.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a big commitment to taking on
somebody for therapy because they are
bringing their difficulties to you.
And they will feel nervous and vulnerable<br />
and they are opening themselves up to be in an intimate relationship with somebody they donâ€™t really know that well, and you have to be able, as the therapist, to hold and contain the longings to be understood at the same time as you know youâ€™re going to be shaking up their values or the way they understand their ways of being in the world, and in the relationship to themselves.</p>

<p>My name is Professor Brett Kahr and I am a practicing psychotherapist in London.
Over the last 125 years the profession of psychotherapy has developed
a multitude of strands. It is now as diverse as for instance the world of music.</p>

<p>I often describe the psychotherapeutic
relationship as a one way relationship
between two people.<br />
There are always two people involved the therapist and the client,
therapist and patient but the focus is 100 percent on the patient.</p>

<p>Talking therapy is a process that unfolds in the most private confidential setting.
The privacy and confidentiality are utterly essential for a successful psychotherapy.<br />
Working full time in psychotherapeutic practice is a very, very profound commitment.</p>

<p>It is a profession that requires a lot of self-nourishment and nourishment from
others in order to put you in that very robust professional position
of looking after so many people in distress.</p>

<h2 id="touch-object-protein-model">Touch object: protein model</h2>

<p>This is a replica of the first model of a protein ever made – the protein myoglobin. You’re welcome to touch and explore the model. It’s attached to a white table, at a height of 75 centimetres. The model is at one end of a freestanding display. To hear the description, position yourself so that the model is to the right, with large print and Braille labels to the left.</p>

<p>Proteins are molecules that perform lots of different functions in our bodies. This model shows a simplified outline of the structure of a protein called myoglobin. Myoglobin is the protein responsible for sending oxygen to our muscles.</p>

<p>As you touch the model, you’ll be aware that it’s composed of irregular, worm-like elements. These are a purplish brown in colour. These worms represent chains of amino acids. Start at the top and identify a small bump or knob towards the tip of one of the worms. From this bump, follow the worm as it winds its way down and round. You’ll discover that the model consists of several separate worms. They’re connected by short rods, coloured a pinkish orange. More of these rods support the structure on its square, light brown base.</p>

<p>Moving back towards the top, just below the bump, you’ll find a disc-like shape in the centre of the model. The disc is coloured a creamy yellow, to make it stand out from the purplish worms that fold around it. This disc represents an iron atom called a haeme, which enables the protein to bond with oxygen.</p>

<p>The protein replica relates to an original model, which is positioned at the other end of this display. The replica you’ve been handling is made of hardwearing plastic and resin. The original model was built out of plasticine; it was made in 1957 by Cambridge scientist John Kendrew.</p>

<p>A real myoglobin protein molecule would be too small to see with the naked eye.  Kendrew’s large-scale and simplified model helped him explain how myoglobin works with our bodies.</p>

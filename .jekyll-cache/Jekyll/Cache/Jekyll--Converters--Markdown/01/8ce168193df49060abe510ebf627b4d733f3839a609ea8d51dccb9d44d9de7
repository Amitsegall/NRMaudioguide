<h2 id="replica-wheels">Replica wheels</h2>

<p>This is an audio description of two wheels. They are on display here and available to touch. These brass replicas are based on an original example made between 1650 and 1670, as London was becoming a leading centre for the making of high-quality, precision scientific instruments. They have been crafted using historical materials and techniques, and demonstrate the precision achieved by hand before mechanisation. Wheel cutting was an extremely important skill, as toothed wheels were used in all manner of scientific instruments and clocks.</p>

<p>The wheels were cast at Coles Castings in Dorset and finished by clockmaker Johan ten Hoeveat The Clockworks in London. The wheel on the right has been cut, finished and polished, and is about 1 millimetre thinner than the unfinished wheel - or blank - on the left, which has been cast but not cut.</p>

<p>The wheels are made of a brass alloy which has a golden gleam. They are approximately 10 centimetres wide and 7 millimetres deep. Both wheels consist of a solid outer ring enclosing a central cross - called a crossing -  which is delineated by four almond-shaped perforations.</p>

<p>The unfinished wheel is chunky, with a black patina mottling the brass. The finished wheel is smooth, slender and shiny. It has 56 individual teeth carved around its edge at regular intervals. They have been marked out using a jig - or dividing guide plate - the gaps between them then roughly filed out, and finally the teeth themselves filed so the tips come to sharp points. A fine, incised line encircles the wheel at the base of the teeth, to indicate how far they should be cut. A pencil sized hole has been hand-drilled at the centre of the crossing to allow the wheel to be mounted.</p>

<p>Here is clockmaker Johan ten Hoeve to explain his process:</p>

<p>A summary of how to make a wheel is you first off got a blank cast which is um basically a cast wheel in rough um we take off the skin by either filing or scraping, you then make a centre point in the middle of the wheel, um you drill a hole in it so you can mount it and turn the outside of the wheel. Concentric? And to the correct size. You then put the wheel in a device whereby you can divide the teeth onto the wheel. You scribe off letâ€™s say sixty teeth â€“ you can scribe it off onto the brass disc. Um You then make the slots between the teeth by cutting them out, filing them out by using a saw or youâ€™re gashing it out. And then you file down the tip of the teeth, which is the most important bit of the wheel. Um Finally, you will remove or file the crossings so it all looks nice and thatâ€™s your finished product.</p>
